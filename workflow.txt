Project Title: Stock Price Prediction
Objective:
To build a predictive model that forecasts stock prices using historical data, incorporating multiple models, and deploying the best-performing model.

Steps:
Data Collection:

Use a stock market API (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance) to collect historical stock prices.
Download data for a specific stock (e.g., Apple Inc. - AAPL).
Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing values.
Perform feature engineering (e.g., creating lag features, moving averages).
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Plot stock prices over time.
Analyze trends, seasonality, and patterns.
Visualize key statistics (e.g., moving averages, volume).
Model Building:

Split data into training and testing sets.
Build multiple models:
ARIMA/SARIMA
LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
Prophet (by Facebook)
Random Forest Regressor (for comparison)
Tune hyperparameters for each model.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate models using metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
Compare model performance.
Model Deployment:

Select the best-performing model.
Create a web application using Flask or Streamlit to deploy the model.
Integrate the model with the web app to display forecasts.
Documentation and Presentation:

Document your code and process in a Jupyter Notebook.
Create a presentation or blog post summarizing your project.
